    \item 18.3. \textbf{“Pick”} Violations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 18.3.1. If a defensive player is guarding one offensive player and they are prevented from moving towards/with that player by another player, that defensive player may call “Pick”. However it is not a pick if both the player being guarded and the obstructing player are making a play on the disc.
            \item 18.3.1.1. Prior to making the "Pick" call, the defender may delay the call up to two (2) seconds to determine if the obstruction will affect the play.
            \item 18.3.2. If play has stopped, the obstructed player may move to the agreed position they would have otherwise occupied if the obstruction had not occurred, unless specified otherwise.
            \item 18.3.3. All players should take reasonable efforts to avoid the occurrence of picks.
            \item 18.3.3.1. During any stoppage opposing players may agree to slightly adjust their locations to avoid potential picks.
