    Morning: such long shadows\\
    like low-bellied cats\\
    creep under parked cars,\\
    and out again, stealthily\\
    flattening the grasses.\\

    At the bus-stop\\
    a flock of starlings\\
    school-children, chatterers\\
    swinging haversacks\\
    pulling ribbons\\

    The driver's got a book by\\
    Sartre in his pocket.\\
    He wears dark glasses,\\
    listens moodily\\
    to the Top Forty.\\

    Life gets better\\
    as I grow older\\
    not giving a damn\\
    and looking slantwise\\
    at everyone's morning.\\
