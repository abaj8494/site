Greetings academics,

Today is the 26th of December, 2023, and it is my 22nd birthday. In celebration of life after yet another lap of the Sun, I have compiled 22 interesting problems that I have encountered this year.

The nature of these problems (at least presently) are largely mathematical and occasionally of a computer science flavour.

There is prize money for the recipients of 1st and 2nd place: \$100 and \$50 respectively.

The rules of the game are enclosed within the PDF. 

Last years Problem Set can be found [here](abaj.io/bday/problems/21.pdf), and the list of previous winners [here](abaj.io/bday/winners). Finally, if you'd prefer to print and have dotted lines to scribble on, that PDF can be found here: abaj.io/bday/problems/22-lined.pdf.

頑張って.
