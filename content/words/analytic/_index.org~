this page contains the final step in [[https://fortelabs.com/][Tiago Forte's]] [[https://fortelabs.com/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/]["progressive summarisation"]] stage. there are between a dozen and two dozen books[fn:2] here that I have _analytically read_[fn:1], and parsed into prose.

* footnotes
[fn:2] note that I have not added epics such as the Holy Bible, Plato's dialogues, Shakespeare's plays, Dante's Comedy, etc.

the viewer must appreciate that to Aayush Bajaj, distillation of such transendental, dense and divine writing is a pathway to mediocre re-representations and sinful idolatry.

[fn:1] as per [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_J._Adler][Mortimer J. Adler]]'s definition of the term in [[/words/how-to-read-a-book][How to Read a Book]].
