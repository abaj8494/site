"One cannot think without writing."---Luhmann[fn:1], 1992

* bookshelf

all of these books have been profoundly influential in sculpting my own character. I also believe these books--but not only[fn:2]--these books, have the capacity to "leverage" any other human /to the tits/.

* footnotes

[fn:1] see [[/words/analytic/how-to-take-smart-notes][how to take smart notes]] to see how Sonke Ahrens distills more of Luhmann's wisdom.

[fn:2] note that I have not added epics such as the Holy Bible, Plato's dialogues, Shakespeare's plays, Dante's Comedy, etc.

the viewer must appreciate that to Aayush Bajaj, distillation of such transendental, dense and divine writing is a pathway to mediocre re-representations and sinful idolatry.
