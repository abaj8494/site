this page contains the final step in [[https://fortelabs.com/][Tiago Forte's]] [[https://fortelabs.com/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/]["progressive summarisation"]] stage. there are between a dozen and two dozen books here that I have _analytically read_[fn:1], and parsed into prose.

all of these books have been profoundly influential in sculpting my own character. I also believe these books--but not only[fn:2]--these books, have the capacity to "leverage" any other human /to the tits/.

happy heckling.

* Footnotes
[fn:2] note that I have not added epics such as the Holy Bible, Plato's dialogues, Shakespeare's plays, Dante's Comedy, etc.

the viewer must appreciate that to Aayush Bajaj, distillation of such transendental, dense and divine writing is a pathway to mediocre re-representations and sinful idolatry.
