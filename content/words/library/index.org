These are all the books that I own / have owned in the past. I have not read them all, neither will I ever be able to.

You walked past the [[/words#the-shelf][rendered SVG]] on your way here.

** tabular

#+INCLUDE: "./books-partials.html" export html


** books

the below headings act as `init`s for each book in the graph database that this website is:

*** networked life

these books are not in any particular order, but rather just here so that I can give each heading a custom `PROPERTY_ID` in the `emacs` html sense, and then hyperlink to the section on this page.

*** the iliad

*** probabilistic machine learning

*** introduction to topology
