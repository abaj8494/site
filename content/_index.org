"We all die. The goal isn't to live forever, the goal is to create something that will."
                                                                                        --- Chuck Palahniuk

Originally the *AI* suffix stood for @@html:<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">archived intellect</span>@@, however these days it has concretised to becoming an *Augmenting Infrastructure* --- a place from which to branch out in many directions.

Within this site you will find self-contained material in the form of [[{{< ref "projects/csp/peg-solitaire" >}}][project posts]] and [[{{< ref "blog/beyond-code" >}}][blog posts]], but also external links [fn:7] to other work I have done on the Internet; GitHub, ArXiV, YouTube, etc.

* Scope

{{< collapse-local folded="true" >}}

Psychology, Biology, Machine Learning and Mathematics; this site is a virtual acreage. 

The breadth of scope does not imply you have entered a circus, but rather alludes to the nonlinearity of knowledge and its structure as a network[fn:2] [fn:3].

My last site was far simpler and served as basic I/O (input output) for myself and my students:

#+BEGIN_CENTER
[[{{< cwd >}}abajio.png]]
#+END_CENTER
The content of this current site is more rigorous and deliberate.

* @@html:<h2 id="nav-heading"><span class="nav-text">Navigation</span></h2><svg id="arrow-svg"></svg>@@

@@html:<font color="orange"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">The site looks MUCH better on Desktop. And slightly moreso in <a href="#" id="darkModeTextToggle" data-popup="ignore" aria-label="Toggle dark mode">dark mode</a>.</span></font>@@
The top right menubar will serve as your main interface to the site. Within it are links to other pages, but at the highest level, every webpage can be discovered through these root nodes.

* Portfolio

If you are visiting in a professional capacity then [[https://github.com/abaj8494][my github]] will give you a better indication of the production-quality code I write.

This site is the spine of my intellect, and is powered by Emacs @@html:<img src="https://abaj.ai/about/emacs.svg" width="20" height="20" class="lateximage" style="vertical-align: -5px;">@@. It allows me to practise [[{{<ref "/blog/literate-programming">}}][Literate Programming]] and [[{{< ref "projects/ml/dl/feedforward" >}}][Typeset Mathematics]] beautifully.

You may also be interested in the [[{{< ref "projects/csp" >}}][projects]] section of this site which tracks my Quest of Conquering Mathematics and Computer Science.

A web CV can be found [[/about/cv][here]].[fn:5]

* Footnotes
[fn:7] any links leading [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ][out]] of this site are proceeded with a =â†—=, whilst those [[#nav-heading][within]] are not.

[fn:5] you may also navigate there serendipitously via the [[about]] page.
