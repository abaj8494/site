The AI could equally as well have stood for Artificial Intelligence.

But that would be a little less /historical/. This site is a way for me to
consolidate everything that which I know[fn:6]. My explorations and discoveries are orated, not for the benefit of strangers, but rather for my future-self.[fn:1]


* Scope

{{< collapse-local folded="true" >}}

Psychology, Biology, Machine Learning and Mathematics; this site is a
virtual acreage. Much in the same way that many things happen on a
farm, many things are happening here.

The breadth of scope does not imply you have entered a circus, but rather alludes to the nonlinearity of knowledge and its structure as a network[fn:2] [fn:3].

My last site was far simpler and served as basic I/O (input output) for myself and my students:

#+BEGIN_CENTER

#+END_CENTER
The content of this current site is more rigorous and deliberate.

* @@html:<h2 id="nav-heading"><span class="nav-text">Navigation</span></h2><svg id="arrow-svg"></svg>@@

@@html:<font color="orange"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">This site looks MUCH better on Desktop. And slightly moreso in <a href="#" id="darkModeTextToggle" aria-label="Toggle dark mode">dark mode</a>.</span></font>@@
The top right menubar will serve as your main interface to the site. Within it are links to other pages, but at the highest level, every webpage can be discovered through these root nodes.

Furthermore, any links leading [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ][out]] of this site are proceeded with a =↗=, whilst those [[#nav-heading][within]] are not.


* Portfolio

If you are visiting in a professional capacity then
[[https://github.com/abaj8494][my github]] will give you a better indication of the production-quality
code I write.

This site humanises me and allows me to practise [[{{<ref "/blog/literate-programming">}}][Literate Programming]]

You may be interested in the [[{{< ref "projects" >}}][projects]] section of this site which outlines every[fn:4] major project I have undertaken.

Furthermore, here is my [[/about/cv][CV]].[fn:5]

* Footnotes

[fn:6] cautiously, we recite Socrates' mantra: "I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing at all".
[fn:5] you may also navigate there serendipitously via the [[about]] page.
