The AI could equally as well have stood for Artificial Intelligence.

But that would be a little less /personal/. This site is a way for me to
consolidate my learnings on topics and share wisdom with my
future-self.[fn:1]

* Scope
Psychology, Biology, Machine Learning and Mathematics; this site is a
virtual acreage. Much in the same way that many things happen on a
farm, many things are happening here.

The top right menubar will serve as your main interface to the site. Within are links to other pages, but at the highest level, every webpage can be discovered through these root nodes.

The breadth of scope does not imply you have entered a circus, but rather that _knowledge is
nonlinear_ and forms a network[fn:2] [fn:3].

* Portfolio
If you are visiting in a professional capacity then

This site humanises me and allows me to practise [[{{<ref "blog/literate-programming.org">}}][Literate Programming]]

section of this site which details the technical construction of the
land upon which you are standing.
