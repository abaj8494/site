future-self.[fn:1]

* Scope
Psychology, Biology, Machine Learning and Mathematics; this site is a
virtual acreage. Much in the same way that many things happen on a
farm, many things are happening here.

This is not to say that *here* is a circus, but rather _knowledge is
nonlinear_ and forms a network[fn:2] [fn:3].

* Portfolio

[[https://github.com/abaj8494][_my github_]] will give you a better indication of the production-quality
code I write.

This site humanises me and allows me to practise [[{{<ref "blog/literate-programming.org">}}][Literate Programming]]

To whet an appetite however; you may be interested in the [[{{< ref "about" >}}][_about_]]

land upon which you are standing.
