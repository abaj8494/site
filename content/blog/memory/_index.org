The human mind is a fickle creature. It is prone to dozens of [[/blogs/cognitive-biases][cognitive biases]], and the way it is strengthened, is paradoxical:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To learn, you must forget
#+END_QUOTE

The above is a mantra all my students are familiar with, and derives from an understanding of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus][Ebbinghaus']] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve][forgetting curve]].

Additionally, the human-mind is highly fragile:
- vulnerable to brain damage (dementia)
- psychological impairments

And biologically expensive:
- contributes a meagre 2% of the human mass
- is responsible for 20% of the body's energy consumption.

Whilst this sword is double-edged; it enables our creativity, capacity for complex thought, reasoning, etc.; the design of this organ leads to largely improper use by its hosts.

Once again, the strengthening of the /brain muscle/ becomes an unintuitive, paradoxical concept---a recurring motif.
