This is Phillip, our boy cat:

Phillip is a Petbarn rescue and a very noisy creature.

We got him at the age of 2 months and 19 days.

We call him Lip, Flip and Frog.

He likes to climb trees and nibble on fingers. He drinks lots of water and pants whilst playing. He is more of a dog than a cat.

Phillip also enjoys eating eggs, butter and cheese and yoghurt. Any diary really.

He is a brave and does not back down from fights, he looks after and plays with his older sister [[/blog/mia][Mia]].

Phillips tail wags like a dog.
