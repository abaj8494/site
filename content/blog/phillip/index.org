This is Phillip, a.k.a Lord Phillip, Prince Phillip.

Phillip was a Petbarn rescue. We got him at the age of 2 months and 19 days.

He likes to climb trees and nibble on fingers. He drinks lots of water and pants whilst playing. He is more of a dog than a cat.

Phillip enjoys eating egg, butter, cheese and yoghurt. Any diary really. He also like Hashbrowns.

He misses his older sister [[/blog/mia][Mia]].
