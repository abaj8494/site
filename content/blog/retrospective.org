I think I do not need to take notes for different technologies. I
should instead just practise using these technologies. This will be
possible if I learn Emacs, because this way I can always efficiently
access the documentation!

Without learning Emacs, gaining an ease-of-use for info, man pages and
other GNU tools would be more difficult.

* GIT
I wonder if I should be bothering to upload my files to GIT. Probably
not. At least not these Org ones.

* Hierarchy
There was a hierarchy that I had intended for my website, but how
about an heirarchy for life first?

      1. site
      2. me
	 1. contact, values, cv (updated DATE)
   5. resources
      1. anki decks
      2. course slides
      3. books
   6. personal (hidden)
      1. family logo
      2. 
	 
* Raison D'etre
S/he who has a why can bear almost any how.

Beyond my anki and todos, the only other thing that I should be doing
is writing. 


* abaj.io
This part is also kind of cool. I plan to host private and large files
from this server. It shall be aliased to my static public IP once I
purchase an official internet connection.

Until then, I'm basically at home anyways, it's not a huge deal, just
a luxury for the future.

Nonetheless I will hold:
- Movies
  - configure jellyfin
- Family Photos
- Frisbee Photos
- Shell access into the raspberry pi
- Emacs journalling
  - this part should be fine, because the rpi4 is currently holding
    the journalling org files anyways.
