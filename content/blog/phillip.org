This is Phillip, our boy cat:

[[/blog/peelip.jpeg]]

Phillip is a Petbarn rescue and a very noisy creature.

We got him at the age of 2 months and 19 days.

We call him Lip, Flip and Frog.

He likes to climb trees and nibble on fingers. He drinks lots of water and pants whilst playing.

Phillip also unusually likes to eat eggs, butter and bread (in that order of preference).

Phillip is brave and does not back down from fights, i.e. against dogs, and gets along with his older sister [[blog/mia][Mia]].

Phillips tail wags like a dog.
