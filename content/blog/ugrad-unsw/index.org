** Summary

It took me 1,577 days to complete my undergraduate degree in Computer Science.

{{< embed-pdf url="/doc/certs/testamur.pdf" hidePaginator="true">}}

Overall, I think the degree was worthwhile and satiated my desire to obtain an understanding of /Computers from the bit-level/.

A succinct table of the courses I took along with their corresponding marks can be found [[/about/cv][here]].

Overall, my favourite courses were [[/projects/mathematics/analysis/real/][Real Analysis]], Professional Issues & Ethics and [[/projects/ml][Machine Learning]].

** Sequentially

This section is a slower burn written for the sake of completeness and retrospection. It documents my experience in every course as I remember it.
