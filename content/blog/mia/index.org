** Tribute
My beautiful, sweet sweet Mia.

Papa's sorry that you're gone, so is [[https://abaj.ai/blog/phillip][Phillip]], and especially is Mama.

We were all shocked and saddened deeply. We grieved and still do.

You made it into Papa's arm, and Mama's leg, we got ink.

I see you every-time I brush my teeth.

** Recount

- Mia was born at my parent's house.
- She had 4 litter-mates.
- She stayed, the others didn't.
- Her mother died to traffic weeks later
- Mia was a cat raised with love from birth.
- She moved out at 1 and then again 6 months in. Her life became more fun, stimulating and interesting.
- She lived outdoors her whole life, ate *roast beef* from *Aldi* and ate salmon from *Costco*.
- She was attacked twice, and turned from the sweetest cat to the "sweetest around family cat"
- She way loyal and supervised much debauchery along with even more destiny-seeking.
- She stopped hissing at [[https://abaj.ai/blog/phillip][Phillip]] eventually, and they even grew together as best-friends for 6-months.
- Mia was killed[fn:1] by a slow moving vehicle.

** Pre-mortem prose:

Mia is a good cat. Very tame. She's been following me around since she was a blue-eyed baby:

She's a beautiful and largely obedient cat. She was born on the 19th of February 2023, making her almost 2 today.

Mia is not the most intelligent cat, but she's very clean.
She is reasonably territorial, and occasionally bitchy.

All things considered, she is a faithful cat that follows me around and responds to being summoned. She also knows how to high-five and stand up.
