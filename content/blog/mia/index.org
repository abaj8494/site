Mia is a good cat. Very tame. She's been following me around since she was a blue-eyed baby:

She's a beautiful and largely obedient cat. She was born on the 19th of February 2023, making her almost 2 today.

Mia is not the most intelligent cat, but she's very clean.
She is reasonably territorial, and occasionally bitchy.

All things considered, she is a faithful cat that follows me around and responds to being summoned. She also knows how to high-five and stand up.
