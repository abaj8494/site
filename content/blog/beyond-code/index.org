These days I work in Emacs, but before then I lived in Vim/Tmux for 2 years. My youth though was never this technical nor was it officially programmatic.

I instead spent my time *hacking*, *tinkering* and /breaking/ things.

I spent my time in primary school creating *hidden folders*[fn:1] on my student drive to hide games from my teachers. But even earlier than that, I had a penchant for doing the wrong thing.

Beyond my relationship with the computer I got into trouble a lot, still do occasionally. I would eventually discover Kali Linux and the wonderful world of *doing-the-wrong-thing* in an environment that made it convenient to do so. Of course, this is not a place to preach my leprosy, but rather an opportunity to express gratitude for never being prosecuted for being a malicious script-kiddy.

As the years passed and I crawled out of my hospital bed[fn:2], I lost touch with Linux. My family used Windows, and so I spent time learning the run-box, manipulating the registry, running rocketdock and deleting System32 every few weeks. I also experimented briefly with the Arduino and Microboard programming[fn:5].

By the age of 16, I had no technical knowledge of what I was doing. I spent time rooting and jailbreaking my devices; manipulating memory addresses as instructed to in some forum or YouTube video.

Eventually the cocoon of High School is shed, and at this point with no coding experience; I become determined to get into Medical School.

I eventually fail the UCAT and fool around in the Medical Science degree at USYD. I then crawl away from the wreckage enrol into a double degree of Computer Science and Commerce at UNSW.

My principle reasoning for choosing the Computer Science portion of the degree was:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
to finally obtain a formal education in computer science from the bit level of abstraction
#+END_QUOTE

Of course, at the time I only had the first half of the above clause: /to obtain a formal education in computers/, but to those of us who have taken a few CS courses, the PC is nothing but a masterful machine of subsequent abstractions.

Real reflections on the content of my course and the insulation wiring that surrounded the degree can be found in the corresponding [[/blog/ugrad-unsw][blog post]].

But, to summarise the degree, my tendency to push against the grain only resulted with me having my teeth kicked in. Specifically, I failed courses for attempting them exclusively in Vim, I failed courses for not learning and using the methods that they taught me[fn:3]. My unsuccesses extend beyond academic life; I didn't get picked on the Frisbee teams I wanted to play for; I lost demerit points; and professionally often ended my employment on bad terms.

Mens conscia recti ---A mind conscious of integrity
#+END_QUOTE

Despite all of this, a consequence of running uphill all these years is a transformation into a more resilient intellectual and powerful programmer. These days I'll happily use VSCode, or PyCharm or whatever proprietary software I must use to get the job done.

Perhaps, because I live quietly these days with a special someone and 2 little special somethings, that I can diversify my portfolio and keep the all-too-many stakeholders in society content.
