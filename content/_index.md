The AI could equally as well have stood for Artificial Intelligence.

But that would be a little less _personal_. This site is a way for me to
consolidate my learnings on various topics and share wisdom with my
future-self.[^fn:1]


## Scope {#scope}

Psychology, Biology, Machine Learning and Mathematics; this site is a
virtual acreage. Much in the same way that many things happen on a
farm, many things are happening here.

The breadth of scope does not imply you have entered a circus, but rather alludes to the nonlinearity of knowledge and its structure as a network[^fn:2] <sup>, </sup>[^fn:3].

The content of this current site is more rigorous and deliberate.


## Navigation {#navigation}

The top right menubar will serve as your main interface to the site. Within it are links to other pages, but at the highest level, every webpage can be discovered through these root nodes.


## Portfolio {#portfolio}

If you are visiting in a professional capacity then
[my github](https://github.com/abaj8494) will give you a better indication of the production-quality
code I write.

This site humanises me and allows me to practise [Literate Programming]({{< relref "literate-programming" >}})

To whet an appetite however; you may be interested in the [projects](/projects)
section of this site which outlines every[^fn:4] major project I have undertaken.
