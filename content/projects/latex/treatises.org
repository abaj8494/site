Eventually I grew tired of numbingly copying out the verse of other authors[fn:2] and began to create things of my own. I only produced 2 treatises, one on Gastropods (snails), and another on the Catus Felis (Domestic[fn:1] Cat).

During this adventure I learned about =maketitle=, References, Glossaries, Figures, Images and page numbering.
