From the moment I laid eyes on a \(\TeX\) typeset document, I fell in love with its style and figure. However, I thought it too difficult to learn, and instead spent my time in markdown.

Eventually whilst mastering that rather limited syntax, I found myself turning to =YAML= headers and \(\LaTeX\) snippets to get my work done with sufficient quality.

At some tipping point, the \(\TeX\) began to intrigue me and I began sloppily typesetting my University Mathematics assignments in \(\TeX\) and later carved out time in my Summer Holidays to work through the necessary tutorials.

This coupled with my ravenous apetite to consume more and more beautiful typesetting led me to producing every document exclusively in \(\LaTeX\).

Since this first deep-dive at the end of 2022, my passion for \(\TeX\) has matured. I have written many documents both professionally and non-professionally with Leslie Lamport's fork of Donald Knuth's magical τϵχ engine.

Back then I began by consulting the standard _"[[https://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files/4bef65c49001dba38e07a049fde3a4c8.pdf][A Short Introduction to Latex]]"_ and then later the _[[https://richardson.byu.edu/624/fall_2023/latex-introduction.pdf]["Not So Short Introduction to Latex]]"_.

I would later continue to invest some money into the matter (along with my time and effort), to purchase and work through Stefan Kottwitz' "A Beginner's Guide to LaTeX". I would eventually also purchase the original manual by Leslie Lamport on Ebay for a steal of $15 AUD. This would be the best front-to-back reading of Latex I have experienced til this day.

Because I was producing Invoices and Educational material with TeX, I could afford to invest more in books and thus fuel my own pyramid scheme. Eventually I ended up with a small stack, including the rest of Stefan Kottwitz' titles, and Frank Mittelbach's newly released TLC:

Below here you will find summaries of \(\TeX\) projects I have embarked on. The source code is always provided, either by way of embedding the source code blocks within the page, or redirecting you to the =nginx= files.

* Conclusion and Advice
At this point, I spend a lot of time referencing code I have already written to solve a particular problem and am pleased with my TeX journey. Initially, I found it difficult to get my hands on the source code that created whichever beautiful document I was holding at the time. Hence the raison d'être for this page.

My advice would be to take the manual of your favourite LaTeX package and click on the option to download it's TeX file on CTAN.

Finally, as of 08/01/25 this page is being archived, any subsequent TeX sophistications can be gleaned from my work on [[{{< ref "/projects/bday-problems" >}}][N Birthday Problems]] which I release each year in a TeX typeset PDF.
