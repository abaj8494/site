** notes

these are some more informal notes that I have made after having taken the rigorous Analysis course.

- $c_{00}$ can be thought of as 'finite vectors'. all $\mathbb{R}^n$ tuples can be written as elements of $c_{00}$ with infinitely many zeros after the $n$th term.
- $c_0$ are all sequences that converge to zero. thus they will include all those in $c_00$ and more.
- $\ell^2$ are the vectors that fade fast enough for their energy {{< mnote "sum of squares" >}} to stay finite
- $\ell^\infty$ are the infinite vectors that never blow up -- their entries are bounded.

\[c_{00} \subset c_0 \subset l^\infty \]

*** $\ell^2$



an example of a sequence in this space is $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2}$.

we start with the definition:
\[\ell^2 = \set{(x_n):\sum_{n=1}^\infty |x_n|^2 < \infty }\]

then
