* Source Code
This is was the first and most green Problem Set. It teetered on the edge of Higher Secondary and Recreational mathematics:
#+INCLUDE: "/code/latex/bday-problems/21/main.tex" src latex

* Solution Set

The winner was *Aarav Bajaj*, by a narrow margin of a single mark.

In second place was an ex-student of mine, *Jisu Song*.

The prize money was $50 and $20 respectively.

** Question 1
Prove that \(\frac{1}{0}\) is undefined.

Assume the negation of the statement: \(\frac{1}{0}\) is defined, s.t. \(\frac{1}{0} = x\). Algebraically swapping the \(x\) and \(0\), we can plot the graph for \(y=\frac{1}{x}\) at \(y=0\):

  X = np.linspace(-10, 10, 101) # the extra value allows plt to land a nan at x=0
  Y = np.reciprocal(X)

  plt.axhline(0, linestyle="--", color="green")
  plt.plot(X, Y, label="Y = 1/X")
  plt.legend()

  plt.grid()
  plt.show()

Now clearly the dotted line never touches the blue curve, and thus at no point does \(0 = \frac{1}{x} \implies \) that our initial assumption was /false/.

In conclusion, \(\frac{1}{0}\) is undefined.

** Q2

RTP: \[\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\]

Proof:

By definition, \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\) and  \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\).

And \[\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}^2 + \text{adjacent}^2}{\text{hypotenuse}^2}\]

Furthermore, by the Pythagorean Theorem on the following figure, we have \(\text{opposite}^2 + \text{adjacent}^2 = \text{hypotenuse}^2\)

And thus \(\frac{\text{hypotenuse}^2}{\text{hypotenuse}^2} = 1\), which was that to be proved. \(\square\)

*** Q2.1


Dividing this equation through \(\sin^2(\theta)\):

\[\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\sin^2(\theta)} +\frac{\cos^2(\theta)}{\sin^2(\theta)} &= \frac{1}{\sin^2(\theta)}\\
\implies 1 + \cot^2(\theta) &= \csc^2(\theta)\text{, as required}
\end{align*}\]
