As is tradition, the prize pool has increased (to $300 this year).

I have collapsed first and second place into a winner-takes-all arrangement (c'est la vie).

Furthermore, there are additional changes to the structure of this Game:
1. you must now *pass* the problem set to be awarded the prize money
2. you may submit your solutions to the problem set at any point in the future -- hopefully your children are smart enough to solve these problems
3. if you plagiarise work, I reserve the right to ban you from all subsequent competitions --- /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_trigger][grim trigger]]/
4. the problem set will now be courteously supported by my JavaScript $\LaTeX$ engine and a PDF will be generated as an artifact of the site;
   - the problems can be found [[/projects/bday-problems/24th/problems][here]] or as a [[/doc/bday-problems/24th.pdf][PDF]] [[/projects/bday-problems/24th/problems][here]]
   - my solutions will be available from the start of 2026; by viewing them you *forfeit the prize money* (obviously)
5. Good luck!
