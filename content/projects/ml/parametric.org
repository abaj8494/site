This accounts for about 60% of the Machine Learning Methods we have.

By definition a /parametric/ model is one that has fixed parameters to learn, i.e. weights in Linear Regression: $w_0, w_1, ..., w_n$.
Conversely, a non-parametric model does not have a /fixed/ number of parameters to learn: K-means clustering for example just clusters the data as best as it can.

We can list some more models:
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Logistic Regression
5. Neural Networks
6. Perceptron
7. Naive Bayes
