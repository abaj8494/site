Computer Scientists are not the ones that are employable, it is the Software Engineers that are.

It has always been this way, and always will be. Software Engineering is connected to the real-world. It is concerned with practical problems:
- architecture and design
- implementation
- testing
- security

Computer Scientists live in a more logical and pure bubble; they prefer specificity to scaffolding. But this bit me in the ass during a /Graduate Consultant/ interview.

Engineers are those that make the world spin. Computer Scientists are just those that understand why it /can/ spin.
