The meat content of this page is to be repurposed for an assignment, however the textuality of Emacs fosters my thinking.

The assignment has a clear focus on Value Sensitive Design --- a term coined by Batya Friedman and Peter Kahn in the late 1980's, and is a theoretically grounded approach to the design of technology that accounts for human values in a principled and comprehensive manner [fn:1].

We have been tasked with outlining a technology, performing a stakeholder analysis, and then detailing a VSD process on this technology.
