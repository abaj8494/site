I am using this project as an excuse to learn [[https://go.dev/][GO]]. 

Each heading below is a tool I have produced, the Go code is tangled into a repository called [[https://github.com/abaj8494/100-days-go][100 Days of Go]] and repurposed at [[tools.abaj.ai][tools.abaj.ai]] --- which serves these convenience mathematical and programmatic tools in a nice frontend.
