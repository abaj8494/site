** Non-descriptive frisbee stats
A computer vision model that takes in streamed games and outputs a player statistic that factors in non-descriptive events --- i.e. giving the correct call at the correct time, or poaching in the lane to force a bad throw.

I expect this to be trained using a transformer and written in Python. It is inspired by [[https://github.com/AndyWood91][Andrew Wood's]] analytical Ultimate dream.
