To manipulate code at the speed of thought. It is the same reason that we learn to touch-type --- to write at the speed of thought.

=gg=: go to the top of the file
=G=: go to the bottom of the file
=b=: go back a word
=f=: go forward a word
teleport to the start of the line, teleport to the end.
replace everything within 2 parenthesis, no worries, it's natural: @@html:<b>c</b>hange <b>i</b>n <b>(</b>@@ = "change in brackets" -- duh!

Beyond being able to manipulate code on _your own_ computer very quickly, the benefit of learning Vim is that you can manipulate code on _any machine_ really quickly.

Vim is available everywhere, and if it isn't where you are, then Vi certainly is.

* My Experience

I am not sure why I started using Vim, perhaps it just seemed obviously better to me. In my youth I was certainly a fan of memorising shortcuts to navigate the PC faster.

Anyways, all you really need to get started is to type in =vimtutor= on the terminal, and with that you can produce a site as simple, yet effective as my friends': [[https://frizzande.io][Andrew Laurence Wood]].

* Portability

This really is the main reason you should be using Vim in today's world. SSH'ing anywhere and not knowing how to manipulate text quickly is a problem. Vim is supported by [[https://overleaf.com][Overleaf]], [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][VSCode]] and basically every other IDE will offer it as an extension.

* Mastering Vim

This takes a long time, even I currently am not there, but I certainly know enough to be useful - that's the magic of Vim.
