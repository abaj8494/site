A revisitation of a good book.

I made a couple naïve attempts at trying to master git circa 2024.

After obtaining the UGrad, I have had a couple months of unemployment to improve my Software Engineering skills.

As such I read more than a small selection of this book and produced the following flashcards[fn:1]:

** Footnotes

[fn:1] note that the formatting of these cards is not guaranteed; they are the [[https://abaj.ai/doc/org/flashcards/soft-eng/git.org][source files]] for my [[https://github.com/anki-editor/anki-editor?tab=readme-ov-file][anki-editor]] workflow.
