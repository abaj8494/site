I am working through the second edition of this book by *Scott Chacon* and *Ben Straub*.

I have printed out the first 100 pages of the book[fn:1], and conducted an /inspectional reading/ (in Mortimer J. Adler's sense of the word).

* Deep Work 1: Git Basics, Git Branching.

- you can either have config details at the /system/ scope, /global/ scope or /local/ scope:
  - =/etc/gitconfig=
  - =~/.config/git/config= or =~/.gitconfig=
  - =./.git/config=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git config --list --show-origin
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| file:/home/alex/.gitconfig | user.email=aayushbajaj7@gmail.com                       |
| file:/home/alex/.gitconfig | user.name=Aayush Bajaj                                  |
| file:.git/config           | core.repositoryformatversion=0                          |
| file:.git/config           | core.filemode=true                                      |
| file:.git/config           | core.bare=false                                         |
| file:.git/config           | core.logallrefupdates=true                              |
| file:.git/config           | remote.origin.url=git@github.com:abaj8494/site          |
| file:.git/config           | remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* |
| file:.git/config           | branch.main.remote=origin                               |
| file:.git/config           | branch.main.merge=refs/heads/main                       |

- we can check what =git= thinks a particular value is with =git config user.name=.
- also you can view everything with =git config --list=.
  - a useful tag with this one though is =git config --show-origin user.name=. because multiple config files can be read!

[fn:1] it turns out that obtaining the physical copy is hardly worth it. ~$75 AUD for a Black and White potentially out-dated copy. meanwhile the authors appear to maintain something more current [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2][here]].
