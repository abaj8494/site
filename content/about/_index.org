* Site

This website was created using the static-site generator [[https://gohugo.io][_Hugo_]]. The base theme is [[https://schnerring.net][_Michael Schnerring's_]] [[https://github.com/schnerring/hugo-theme-gruvbox][_Gruvbox_]], and I have written the content using org-mode in Emacs. The git repository for this site can be found [[https://github.com/abaj8494/abaj.ai][here]].

The icon for the site is the real component contour plot of the 4D complex exponential function. A slightly higher fidelity figure can be seen below and Wolfram's article on the function from where I have taken this figure can be found [[https://functions.wolfram.com/ElementaryFunctions/Exp/visualizations/5/][here]].

* Me

I'm not stone-cold. Here's me:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return(1)
    else:
        return(n*factorial(n-1))

return(factorial(5))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
echo "test"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: test

todo: add ultimate 24 unigames

I play Ultimate Frisbee and have 2 cats. I ride an Enfield Bullet and built most of this site on an =aarch64= RaspberryPi 4. I study Japanese out of adoration for the language, and own hundreds of books. I really like TeX[fn:1] and black rap. I'm also musically retarded.

TODO: add rpi4 setup
TODO: tex stack of books
TODO: add spotify wrapped 2023?
