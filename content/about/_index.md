## Site {#site}

This website was created using the static-site generator [<span class="underline">Hugo</span>](https://gohugo.io). The base theme is [<span class="underline">Michael Schnerring's</span>](https://schnerring.net) [<span class="underline">Gruvbox</span>](https://github.com/schnerring/hugo-theme-gruvbox), and I have written the content using org-mode in Emacs. The git repository for this site can be found [here](https://github.com/abaj8494/abaj.ai).

The icon for the site is the real component contour plot of the 4D complex exponential function. A slightly higher fidelity figure can be seen below and Wolfram's article on the function from where I have taken this figure can be found [here](https://functions.wolfram.com/ElementaryFunctions/Exp/visualizations/5/).

## Me {#me}

I'm not stone-cold. Here's me:

{{< figure src="/images/happy-j.jpg" width="300px" >}}

I play Ultimate Frisbee and have 2 cats. I ride an Enfield Bullet and built most of this site on an `aarch64` RaspberryPi 4. I study Japanese out of adoration for the language, and own hundreds of books. I really like TeX[^fn:1] and black rap. I'm also musically retarded.
