Hello


## Phillip the Boy Cat {#phillip}

This is Phillip, our boy cat:

{{< figure src="/blog/peelip.jpeg" width="700px" >}}

Phillip is a Petbarn rescue and a very noisy creature.

We got him at the age of 2 months and 19 days.

We call him Lip, Flip and Frog.

He likes to climb trees and nibble on fingers. He drinks lots of water and pants whilst playing.

Phillip also unusually likes to eat eggs, butter and bread (in that order of preference).

Phillip is brave and does not back down from fights, i.e. against dogs, and gets along with his older sister [Mia](/blog/mia).

Phillips tail wags like a dog.

## 2018 Royal Enfield Classic 500 {#enfield}

This is my first bike, I bought it second hand:

{{< figure src="/blog/500-listing.jpg" width="900px" >}}

I got it because it fit my needs:

-   comfortable 2 seater
-   royal enfield
-   affordable

I paid 5.5k AUD for it, and recently had to spend another 2k because the previous owner had let it rust from the rain of the Northern Beaches.

I had also tried to do some work on it and ended up snapping the bolt securing the oil filter cap on the underside of the engine.

<div class="org-center">

{{< figure src="/blog/500-screw.png" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>Oil filter cap bolt" width="400px" >}}

</div>

This was my first lesson: from the perspective of the underside of the bike, "lefty loosey" is actually "righty-tighty".

**Lesson 2** purchase a torque wrench.


### Raison d'Ãªtre {#raison-d-Ãªtre}

This page exists mainly for myself, but I do hope it is control-f-able. the above table of contents should help orient you, and if you have this same bike, this whole page is a document of my experience with it.
Below here I shall have a lessons section with individual aspects of riding as well as the motorcycle that I have been trying to master. Finally, I have attached the User's manual, Service manual, and my own paid copy of Haynes' Service Manual for the 2018 Class 500 in [the resources section](/resources).


### Lessons {#lessons}


#### Stalling the bike {#stalling-the-bike}

I purchased this motorcycle from a Mr. Reynes House, the first owner and Royal Enfield (RE) fanatic. A 39 year-old gentleman who regrettingly parted with this Bullet. Whilst there is much to say about Mr. House, he is not the topic for this section; the topic is the many times I stalled this bike on the way away from Mr. Houses house!

I completed my learner's course in Silverwater under the most strange but thorough instructor: Neil Singh. I - to this day - have mixed opinions about Neil Singh. He taught me not to look down at my dashboard, but also insisted upon not explaining the neutral gear to me. He went on to fail 2 of 5 from my class that course. I, luckily passed.
My reason for introducing Mr. Singh was to mention the bikes he taught us on: Honda 125cc (model to be researched).

Pulling away from the dirt patch upon which Reynes sold me his bike, I could not do better than pedal on the footpath in Neutral; climb into first gear in an alleyway; and then proceed to stall and almost drop the bike as soon as I hit the first left turn to merge into traffic.
Eventually, admitting defeat I called Reynes and he dropped me (and the new bike) to _my_ house.[^fn:2]

---

Once the bike was in my driveway things became slightly easier. I would later stress about snapping a bolt on the bike, but at this timestep, my primary concern was not dropping the bike.

I took it out as often as I could at the start, keeping the trips short. I went from getting into 2nd and 3rd gear, to getting into those gears faster.
Touching fourth and bringing it back down.

These days I basically hang out in 3rd and 4th exclusively, relying on engine braking to hold speed and letting my clutch breathe. I am overworking the clutch on my slow-speed maneouvres however.

I stalled the bike twice today; once upon hitting a speed-bump -- I'm not entirely certain what happened there, and once again in the frontyard trying to get it off the grass.
Before then though, it's been about a week. As I am becoming more comfortable with the friction zone and correct clutch habits, my frequency of stalling the bike has dropped quickly.


#### Overusing the Clutch {#overusing-the-clutch}

The previous lesson brings me to a very surreal image that triggered the realisation that I was **coasting with the clutch in** almost all of the time.

You see, because I was so afraid of letting go of the clutch - and thus perhaps stalling the bike - I always pulled my clutch in. Around corners, down hills, etc.

This only lasted about a week until a shorter, skinnier, but equally as cool Jason Mamoa gapped me on Victoria Road.
He goes around the bend ahead of me in a thin white sporty dirt bike perhaps 250cc or so and flicks his visor up whilst at speed.

He gestures to his eyes and then to his clutch arm, which was dangling by his side, and that's how he took the turn.

Bewildered at the time it would only click about 10 days later what that dread-haired dude was trying to teach me.


#### Not wearing protective equipment {#not-wearing-protective-equipment}

I still don't think you have to. There is an artful video by [fortnine/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nINIJ1cAbYM) on YouTube explaining the statistical futility on relying on protective equipment to save you in the event of a crash. At that point, a road rash _seems_ trivial.

Anyways, my point being, it gets cold -- up to 20Â° degrees colder!


#### My helmet was too big {#my-helmet-was-too-big}

I thought it wasn't when the folks at MCA first told me, but after about a month of riding I began to understand how much room I really had in my helmet --- room with which I could whiplash my brain.


#### Engine Braking {#engine-braking}

As soon as I took my hands off the clutch I began to experience the pitfalls and advantages of engine breaking.

Suddenly, the emphasis became throttle control and letting the engine do the work, as opposed to clutching the clutch for life support and sanding down my disc brakes.

Overall, incorporating this technique has been an immense success, especially from a safety stand-point, though at times I still get it wrong and jerk forward at a lesser 10kph.


####  {#d41d8c}


#### Quick shifting {#quick-shifting}

This is one of the things I saw on YouTube early onwards but only came to realise its relevance when trying to pull away from traffic on a green light with a 200kg bike.

I had to wait a while before being able to learn this skill due to the bike being in the shop, and then additionally there being an accidental breakage of the fuel pump. Luckily this breakage was covered by the workshop warranty and the folks at Motomachine Clyde.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Upshifting

    I have been at it now for perhaps a week and I am finding that it can be done smoothly - if I preload the upshift lever and then drop the revs, I have an easier time moving up a gear. In addition to this, I am finding the transition between 1st and 2nd gear most challenging. I believe this is due it being the highest magnitude gear ratio:

    1st 3.06:1
    2nd 2.01:1
    3rd 1.52:1
    4th 1.21:1
    5th 1:1

    I also believe upshifting into a higher gear is easier when the revs of the motorcycle are high. See my lesson below for taking the revs of the motorcycle _too_ high.

    Log 13/12/2024:
    I am realising it is quite possible to get stuck in **neutral** when upshifting from first to second. Be careful of this.
    I am also learning new grips which is propagating into relearning quick-shifting.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Downshifting

    I have not yet experimented with this, mainly because I do not feel it to be that useful.

    One thing to keep in mind is quick shifting will almost always be less smooth than the control that you have when clutch shifting.

    It is faster, and can be more fun, but it is also more harmful for the gearbox, and at times jerky.


#### Killing the engine with revs {#killing-the-engine-with-revs}

After getting the bike back from the shop I was out on a nice windy road one day and just yanked back the throttle all the way as a small means to vent emotionally. Suffice to say it did not go my way. I was in third and suddenly the bike had died. Was it my throttle cable that snapped? No, I just got that replaced. Am I out of fuel? No, I should have plenty.

OMG, it's that thing that Reynes, almost fleetingly mentioned; "if the revs go too high the engine will cut out; it's a safety thing".

Anyways, that's exactly what happened. I wonder if this can happen to all manual transmission vehicles.


#### U-turns {#u-turns}

This is where we are at now.


#### Breaking the mirror {#breaking-the-mirror}

I tried to wash the motorcycle on grass and ended up tipping it onto the exhaust side. Inevitably the mirror broke and now I have purchased these demon horns:

TODO: image

These touring mirrors though are inappropriate for this bike. The dealer warned me they weren't listed as suitable and after a single ride I understand why.

The Bullet 500cc is a very rumbly bike, and looking in the mirrors beyond 70kph is equivalent to me trying to see something without my glasses -- very blurry.
Furthermore, I cannot see behind myself. As a rider who likes seeing directly behind them, this is a major problem.

I shall be returning these mirrors and asking Motomachines to order the part from their Victoria warehouse.


#### Relearning grips {#relearning-grips}

I am relearning both the clutch handle grip, and the front brake grip. On the clutch side, two fingers is sufficient, but this means I am relearning my friction zone with these new set of muscles.

As for the front brake grip, there are often times where I want to be downshifting whilst slowing down (using the front brake), as a result I need to blip the throttle to rev match and smoothly drop a gear.

My right hand grip looks like this when blipping the throttle with the front brake pulled in:

And here is my clutch grip:

## beyond code <span class="tag"><span class="kali">kali</span></span> {#beyond-code}

I work in Emacs and lived in Vim for 2 years. My youth though was spent creating **hidden folders**[^fn:3] on my primary school student drive to hide games from my teachers.

Even earlier than that, though, I had a penchant for doing the wrong thing.

Beyond my relationship with the computer I got into trouble a lot, still do occasionally; but my non-binary life is not what you are here for.

I would later discover Kali Linux and the wonderful world of **doing-the-wrong-thing** in an environment that made it convenient to do so. Of course, here is not the place to divulge the details of my leprosy, but rather a place to express gratitude for never being prosecuted for these script-kiddy adventures.

TODO: image of kali linux and my back tattoo

As the years passed and I crawled out of my hospital bed[^fn:4], I lost touch with Linux. My family used Windows, and so I spent time learning the run-box, manipulating the registry, running rocketdock and deleting System32 every few weeks.

TODO: image runbox, rocketdock, registry

At this point I must be 16 and beyond smashing away at the keyboard I had no technical knowledge of what I was doing. I spent time rooting and jailbreaking my devices; manipulating memory addresses as specified by some dodgy YouTube video, but even then I did not know what I was doing.
High school comes to an end, and at this point I have no coding experience; I am determined to get into Medical School.

Anyways, I fail the UCAT, tank the Medical Science degree at USYD and eventually crawl into a double degree of Computer Science and Commerce at UNSW.

TODO: image usyd

My principle reasoning for choosing the Computer Science portion of the degree was: _to finally obtain a formal education in computer science from the bit level of abstraction_.

Of course, at the time I only had the first half of the previous clause: _to obtain a formal education in computers_, but to those of us who have taken a few CS courses, the PC is nothing but a masterful machine of subsequent abstractions.

Real reflections on the content of my course and the insulation wiring that surrounded the degree can be found in the corresponding [blog post](/blog/ugrad-unsw).

But, to summarise the degree, my tendency to push against the grain only resulted with me having my teeth kicked in. Time after time after time.

Specifically, I failed courses for attempting them exclusively in Vim, I failed courses for not learning and using the methods that they taught me[^fn:5]. I didn't get picked on the teams I wanted to play for[^fn:6], and professionally usually ended my employment on bad terms.

> Mens conscia recti ---A mind conscious of integrity

Anyways, I think as a consequence of running uphill all these years I've become a more resilient intellectual and powerful programmer. These days I happily use VSCode, or PyCharm or whatever proprietary software I must use to get the job done.

Perhaps, because I live quietly these days with a special someone and 2 little special somethings, that I can diversify my portfolio and remain myself within a society.


## running barefoot {#barefoot-running}

Here lie my meditations on running barefoot for a year.

I do not recommend it. Especially in the city where it is likely that your running surface will be concrete or pavement.

It is terrible for your feet, and worse for your knees. It is dangerous and it is painful, please do not do it.

Now having given this disclaimer I shall proceed to justify and describe my experience clocking about 300km(?) barefoot.

Now you must understand that in addition to not wearing shoes, I was often not wearing a shirt. I had a beard and a dragon tattoo on my back and was largely running on the roads; a foolish endeavour.

Nonetheless, it was a profound experience for me. I had also begun my voyage of sobriety coupled with a serious commitment to my mathematics. Hitting the bare concrete with my feet seemed a fitting feat at the time.

Iâ€™m glad I did it, and I will carry the not-so-flesh wounds that a year of doing this has left me with.

My feet are significantly calloused, along with my mind (somewhat). Though I do not consider this of benefit as occassionally a cold day will cause 4/10 pain or particular points of my feet are basically just Achillesâ€™ heels.

Once again, for the sake of your imagination, I was 21 years old during this. Iâ€™d run on concrete, punch walls and climb trees. Iâ€™d do my calculus, lament for love and listen to Kanye.

All in all a significant episode, but one that was contigent on my very personal and otherwise unnatural lifestyle.

Beyond the metaphysical, I do have technical advice for those who have (carefully) decided to try this:

Start slow. The feet are the main restrictors here. For the most part they have been cacooned in the marshmallow capitalistic product that are shoes. Your feet are not acclimated to the hardness and roughness of the floor. Just start running a little slower.
As your feet harden (I suggest starting to run in the summer so your feet do not bleed), you will begin to learn more about the floor you step on. You will become more cautious and compassionate about the floor you use for locomotion and also will learn about **watching where you step** (a deep philosophical lesson)
Your feet will become dirty and you will have consolations about cleanliness; another philosophical lesson. c.f. Diogenes.
It will fucking hurt. You will question the pain. You might quit. You probably should.
If you donâ€™t quit you begin to channel the pain. You make it worth it. You acknowledge that this must be a phase and cannot continue indefinitely. You would need to run this way on grass or dirt. Do you move away or just put on shoes and conform?
My answer to the ephemeralism was to make pilgrimages. It can be in the form of a parkrun, or something more metaphorically meaningful: a run to the library, a voyage to a tree.
At this point you will also acknowledge that you will quite simply never be as fast as someone with running shoes. They have extra springs under their foots!
If you make it this far, it remains a permanent asset for you. You can cover ground quickly without shoes should the need ever arise. Great optionality, a powerful position. c.f. Nassim Nicholas Taleb
Choosing to take a bite of concrete on each subsequent step does toughen the soul.
Oh, and yes you can also paint your nails and look at them - thatâ€™s always rather fun.
I forgot a couple more: your feet will expand and they will get more hot too. Iâ€™m not sure why this happens more without shoes, but when you put shoes back on you will really notice it.
Your feet will begin to develop a musculature from having to grip onto the Earth
Where am I now?

Iâ€™ve done my undergraduate reps of this. I think I shall return to this to nail a consistent sub 20 minute parkrun and (fingers crossed) maybe a full marathon barefoot. Ah, bonus tip, realise that you lack cushioning and so cannot afford the same stride length as other runners; increase your cadence and step shorter but quicker!

In my present day, I have been gifted a Garmin Venu 3 and think it is time to study the metrics of my movement to improve my running in this way. I have just turned 22 and the goal - to which you all may hold me accountable is 22km weeks. 2023 was a year of discipline, 24 shall be of consistency.

Happy New Year Yâ€™all and Goodluck to those who wish to try this. :D

P.S. bindiis still suck!


## the bayesian cat {#the-bayesian-cat}

This blog post has been created to convince you that real-world
probability, is in fact <span class="underline">Bayesian</span> probability.

Anyone who believes that a frequentist approach is superior may be
correct (for that particular example), but it must be said that the
Bayesian framework is a superset of this naive and trivial
card-playing model of probability.

We are no longer trying to determine the probability of landing a
\`double-six\` dice roll, and rather we are trying to figure out what
the probability is that Mia (our cat) will be waiting for us on the
porch when we get home.


### History (optional) {#history--optional}

It starts with Cardano, leads to Pascal and Leibniz. Makes its way to
**insert russian dude**, blah blah blah.


### The Crux of the Matter {#the-crux-of-the-matter}

Prior. That is the crux. What is the probability Mia will be waiting
on the chair on the porch? Well that depends on a few things: is it
raining? did we feed her before we left? is it really hot? did she get
into another cat fight?

Each of these questions, either answered or unanswered influence the
probability.

Formally we have P(Mia on Red Chair) =
